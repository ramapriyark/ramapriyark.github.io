        Hi! I'm Ramapriya, a Frontend/UI Engineer who loves all things tech. I have too many
        interests and fall down metaphorical rabbit holes all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not a typical blog. It's the (future) home of my notes as I remaster web development and explore anything else that
        catches my interest. You're welcome to follow along, but keep in mind, this is an eternal work in progress and things may
        shift day to day.
      </p>
